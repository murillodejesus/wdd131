            <p>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side,

                that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, 
                and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p>

            <p>For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, 
                which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able 
                to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not 
                able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, 
                according to his will and pleasure?</p>
